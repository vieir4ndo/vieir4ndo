### 🍰 About me

I'm **Matheus Vieira Santos**, I am a software developer currently living and working in Brazil 🇧🇷. I like to think of myself as an extroverted, excited and proactive person. I really do believe in the transforming power of education and, in this perspective, I'm always engaged in different projects.

### 🎓 Education

I'm a Computer Science Technician graduated from the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC) and, nowadays, I'm in the sixth semester of my Bachelor in Computer Science in the Federal University of Fronteira Sul (UFFS).

### ⚒️ Work

My work experience has started back in 2018 when I was still in my technician course. I worked as a Trainee at the Porto's Superior Institute of Engineering (ISEP) in Portugal, mainly with Front-End developing. This experience lasted for a semester as it was a contracted partnership between the school I studied in Brazil and ISEP. Later in 2020, after I graduated from my technician course and enrolled at university, I started working at Questor Systems S/A as a Trainee in the Full Stack segmentation. After a year working there I got promoted to the position of Junior Full Stack Developer and I stood in this position for almost a year until I decided to leave the company. Finally, nowadays I work as a Junior Back-End Developer at Stone Co.
